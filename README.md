## Description

This module currently ensures that the ZFS packages available from
[zfsonlinux.org](http://zfsonlinux.org) are installed and configured.

RHEL/CentOS, Ubuntu and Debian are supported using Puppet 4.4.0 or later. On
RHEL/CentOS platforms there is support for installing the kABI-tracking kernel
modules as opposed to the default of DKMS-style kernel modules.

## Setup

### What zfs affects

This module will install kernel modules which utilises the DKMS framework to
accomplish this. This means kernel headers, toolchains, etc. will be installed.

### Setup Requirements

You will need pluginsync enabled. On RHEL/CentOS platforms you will need to
have access to the EPEL repository by using
[stahnma/epel](https://forge.puppet.com/stahnma/epel) or by other means to
use the DKMS-style kernel modules. On Debian 8 you will need to enable
backports using
[puppetlabs/apt](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/apt) with something like:

```puppet
::apt::setting { 'conf-validity':
  content => @(EOS/L),
    Acquire::Check-Valid-Until "false";
    | EOS
}

class { '::apt::backports':
  location => 'http://archive.debian.org/debian',
  pin      => 500,
}
```

Debian 9 and higher require the contrib repository which can be enabled with:

```puppet
::apt::source { 'contrib':
  location => 'http://deb.debian.org/debian',
  repos    => 'contrib',
}
```

### Beginning with zfs

In the very simplest case, you can just include the following:

```puppet
include ::zfs
```

## Usage

For example on RHEL/CentOS to instead install the kABI-tracking kernel modules
and tune the ARC, you can do:

```puppet
class { '::zfs':
  kmod_type   => 'kmod',
  zfs_arc_max => to_bytes('256 M'),
  zfs_arc_min => to_bytes('128 M'),
}
```

To also install the ZFS Event Daemon (zed):

```puppet
include ::zfs
include ::zfs::zed
```

## Reference

The reference documentation is generated with
[puppet-strings](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-strings) and the latest
version of the documentation is hosted at
[https://bodgit.github.io/puppet-zfs/](https://bodgit.github.io/puppet-zfs/).

## Limitations

This module has been built on and tested against Puppet 4.4.0 and higher.

The module has been tested on:

* RedHat Enterprise Linux 6/7
* Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04
* Debian 8, 9

It should also work on Ubuntu 12.04/14.04 however the quality of some aspects
of the packages make it difficult for the module to work properly.

## Development

The module has both [rspec-puppet](http://rspec-puppet.com) and
[beaker-rspec](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker-rspec) tests. Run them
with:

```
$ bundle exec rake test
$ PUPPET_INSTALL_TYPE=agent PUPPET_INSTALL_VERSION=x.y.z bundle exec rake beaker:<nodeset>
```
